			Coinvoy is a Bitcoin wallet that is yours and yours only.
			</p>
			<p>
			Your addresses and keys are dynamically produced on the fly with the information you provide. Valuable information is instantly destroyed right after your transaction is built and signed.
			</p>
			<p>
			Coinvoy users can store, spend, collect or distribute their Bitcoin funds with a piece of mind, knowing that even the collapse of all Coinvoy Project will NOT effect their Bitcoin funds

			It would be great to hear your ideas. For any feedback or discussion please send an email to support@coinvoy.net.
