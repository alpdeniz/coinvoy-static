			Coinvoy is a Bitcoin wallet that is yours and yours only.
			</p>
			<p>
			Apart from the multisignature technology proven to be the highest security measure in Bitcoin safekeeping, Coinvoy offers 100% independence in Bitcoin ownership. This means that once your wallet is created, Coinvoy Project can never reach your funds nor lose your information to anyone else.
			</p>
			<p>
			Your addresses and keys are dynamically produced on the fly with the information you provide. Valuable information is instantly destroyed right after your transaction is built and signed.
			</p>
			<p>
			Coinvoy users can store, spend, collect or distribute their Bitcoin funds with a piece of mind, knowing that even the collapse of all Coinvoy Project will NOT effect their Bitcoin funds
			</p>
			<p>
			It would be great to hear your ideas. For any feedback or discussion please send an email to support@coinvoy.net.
