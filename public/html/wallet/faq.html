				What is Bitcoin?
			</div>
			<div class="faqAnswer">
				Bitcoin is a decentralized online currency, in which no regulative institution exists. Bitcoins virtually exist in a public ledger system, called the blockchain. You can receive, store and send funds to anywhere in the world. They can be utilized by shopping in online merchants, or by exchanging them to local currencies through Bitcoin ATMs or exchange platforms in the country of your bank account.

			<div class="faqQuestion">
				What is the catch here?
			</div>
			<div class="faqAnswer">
				We created a wallet that brings Bitcoin's philosophy to everyone while keeping the user away from the complexity of this technology: Decentralization, anonymity and ease of use. <b>PopCornTime</b> might just be a good example: It makes Torrent technology as easy as it can get, for everyone.<br>
				In this particular case, Coinvoy tries to provide an easy interface for everyone, in the most secure way possible: No one has access but you, yet you can reset your password and recover your PIN.<br><br>
				Isn't it great? If it is not great for you, please let us know how it can get better by sending an email to support@coinvoy.net.

			<div class="faqQuestion">
				How secure is this wallet?
			</div>
			<div class="faqAnswer">
				We do not have any word on your wallet. Even if our servers are comprimised you have no risk of losing your coins. If servers are gone away, you can still reach your Bitcoins by using a simple offline script we provide. An unusually strong encryption is employed on your browser which generates your most secret keys on-the-fly when they are needed. And all of it luckily happens very very fast, thanks to AsmCryptoJS library.
