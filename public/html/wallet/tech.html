				This wallet is the consequence of an effort to create a fully secure and easy-to-use interface that needs no trust.

				As you notice, the site and documentation is still under construction. However, here are some specs:
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					User login : 60K rounds of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512.
					</li>
					<li>
					Secret hash: Hash of answers is encrypted with a derivative of password hash + PIN using 10K rounds of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 + AES-256 and kept in DB.
					</li>
					<li>
					Encrypted PIN: Encrypted with user information hash using 10K rounds of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 + AES-256 and kept in DB.
					</li>
					Master Private Key: Generated with PIN + User information hash through 30K rounds of PBKDF2.
					<li>
					Wallet Addresses: Multi-signature key pairs generated through cross-matching children of the master node. Receiving addreses are generated and managed in the server by using the master public key.
					</li>
				</ul>

				All operations takes place in client-side JS and all password derivation is completed with user's unique salt.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				This scheme makes password and PIN recovery possible by providing high entropy for all encrypted data.
